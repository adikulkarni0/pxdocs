## PKS preparation

Before installing Portworx, let's ensure the PKS environment is prepared correctly.

### Portworx prerequisites

Ensure that your PKS cluster meets the [minimum requirements](/install-portworx/prerequisites) for Portworx.

### Enable privileged containers and kubectl exec

Ensure that the following options are selected on all plans on the PKS tile:

  * Enable Privileged Containers
  * Disable DenyEscalatingExec (this is useful for using `kubectl exec` to run `pxctl` commands)

### Enable zero downtime upgrades for Portworx PKS clusters

Use the following steps to add a runtime addon to the [Bosh Director](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-components/#director) to stop the Portworx service.

{{<info>}}
**Why is this needed?** When stopping and upgrading instances bosh attempts to unmount _/var/vcap/store_. Portworx has its root filesystem for its OCI container mounted on _/var/vcap/store/opt/pwx/oci_ and the runc container is running using it. So one needs to stop Portworx and unmount _/var/vcap/store/opt/pwx/oci_ in order to allow bosh to proceed with stopping the instances. The addon ensures this is done automatically and enables zero downtime upgrades.

Perform these steps on any machine where you have the bosh CLI.

1. Create and upload the release.

    Replace _director-environment_ below with the environment which points to the Bosh Director.

    ```text
    git clone https://github.com/portworx/portworx-stop-bosh-release.git
    cd portworx-stop-bosh-release
    mkdir src
    bosh create-release --final --version=1.0.0
    bosh -e director-environment upload-release
    ```

2. Add the addon to the Bosh Director.

    First, let's fetch your current Bosh Director runtime config:

    ```text
    bosh -e director-environment runtime-config
    ```

    If this is empty, you can simply use the runtime config at [runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portworx/portworx-stop-bosh-release/master/runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml).

    If you already have an existing runtime config, add the release and addon in [runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portworx/portworx-stop-bosh-release/master/runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml) to your existing runtime config.


    Once we have the runtime config file prepared, let's update it in the Director:

    ```text
    bosh -e director-environment update-runtime-config runtime-configs/director-runtime-config.yaml
    ```

3. Apply the changes.

    After the runtime config is updated, go to your Operations Manager Installation Dashboard and click "Apply Changes". This will ensure bosh will add the addon on all new vm instances.

    If you already have an existing Portworx cluster, you will need to recreate the VM instances using the bosh recreate command.

## Installing Portworx

For on-premises clusters, PKS (Pivotal Container Service) supports VMware vSphere.
