## Overview

Starting with version 2.1, Portworx introduced support for RBAC. This document outlines how to manage your own custom roles for fine-grained access control within your Portworx clusters.

## Default Roles

Portworx comes with a few standard roles that you can use when issuing tokens to users:

*   __system.admin:__ can run any command
*   __system.view:__ can only run read-only commands
*   __system.user:__ can only access volume lifecycle commands
*   __system.guest:__ similar to system.user, but for public volumes only.

All of these roles are immutable, except for system.guest. Admins may [update the system.guest role](/reference/cli/role/#updating-the-system-guest-role) to change how Portworx RBAC handles unauthenticated users.

## Custom Roles

`pxctl role` gives you more fine-grained control over what users can do within your clusters. Let’s get a feel of the available commands by running:

```text
pxctl role --help
```

```output
Portworx pxctl authorization role commands.  Roles define permission rules for users capabilities.

Usage:
  pxctl role [flags]
  pxctl role [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create a role
  delete      Delete a role
  inspect     Show permission rules for role(s)
  list        Show all role names
  update      Update a role

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for role

Global Flags:
      --ca string            path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string          path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color                output with color coding
      --config string        config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string       context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json                 output in json
      --key string           path to client key for ssl usage
      --output-type string   use "wide" to show more details
      --raw                  raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl                  ssl enabled for portworx

Use "pxctl role [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

<!--
We added a new command:
  inspect     Show permission rules for role(s)
Do we want to document it?
-->

### Creating a custom role from a JSON file

To define a custom role, you should first create a `JSON` file that describes that role. Say you've created a file named `role.json`. Then, to create the custom role, you will have to run this command:

```text
pxctl role create --role-config role.json
```

If the details are fuzzy, take a moment to run the following:

```text
pxctl role create --help
```

```output
Create a role using a json file which specifies the role and its rules.  A role consist of a set of rules defining services
and api's which are allowable.
e.g. Rule file which allows inspection of any object and listings of only volumes:
  {
     "name": "test.view",
     "rules": [
       {
         "services": [
           "volumes"
         ],
         "apis": [
           "*enumerate*"
         ]
       },
       {
         "services": [
           "*"
         ],
         "apis": [
           "inspect*"
         ]
       }
     ]
  }

Usage:
  pxctl role create [flags]

Examples:
pxctl role create --role-config <path to json file>

Flags:
  -h, --help                 help for create
      --role-config string   (Required) create role using role json file

Global Flags:
      --ca string            path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string          path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color                output with color coding
      --config string        config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string       context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json                 output in json
      --key string           path to client key for ssl usage
      --output-type string   use "wide" to show more details
      --raw                  raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl                  ssl enabled for portworx
```

#### Role configuration

A role configuration is comprised of a name and a list of rules. Each rule has the following:

* __Services:__ Which services you want to provide access to.
* __APIs:__ Which APIs you want to provide access to. You can use a simple regular expression to represent multiple APIs. i.e. to allow all enumerate APIs, add an entry `*enumerate*` to your `"apis"` array (see below).

__Example configuration (role.json):__

The following example configuration only allows access to volume enumerate commands and all inspect APIs for every service.
```text
{
 	"name": "test.view",
 	"rules": [{
 			"services": [
 				"volumes"
 			],
 			"apis": [
 				"*enumerate*"
 			]
 		},
 		{
 			"services": [
 				"*"
 			],
 			"apis": [
 				"inspect*"
 			]
 		}
 	]
}
```
### Services and APIs

To see all services and APIs you can use within your custom roles, see our [API documentation](https://libopenstorage.github.io/w/reference.html).

### Other role commands
*   To __delete__ a role, you can use `pxctl role delete <name>`
*   To __list__ all roles, you can use `pxctl role list`
*   To __update__ a role, you can use `pxctl role update --role-config <path to JSON config>`. This `JSON` config file is similar to the one used for `pxctl role create`.

## Using your custom roles
Once you've created your custom roles, you can simply add the role names during token generation/user management.

 Add the custom role in your auth-config during token creation:

```
name: Jim Stevens
email: jstevens@portworx.com
sub: jstevens@portworx.com/jstevens
roles: ["test.view"]
groups: ["*"]
```

This token will now allow access to whichever services and APIs were defined in the custom role `test.view`.

## Updating the System Guest role

Updating the `system.guest` role will change how Portworx authorization handles users that do not pass a token to any Portworx operation or SDK call. For more information, see the [guest role overview](/concepts/authorization/overview#guest-access-role).

### Disabling the System Guest role

To disable the system.guest role, perform the following steps:

1. On one of your Portworx nodes, create the following `role.json` file:

    ```text
    {
      "name": "system.guest",
      "rules": [{
        "services": [
          "!*"
        ],
        "apis": [
          "!*"
        ]
      }]
    }
    ```

2. Run the following `pxctl role update` command, specifying your `role.json` config:

    ```text
    pxctl role update --role-config role.json
    ```

### Re-enabling the system.guest role

To re-enable the `system.guest` role to its default behavior, perform the following steps:

1. Create the following `role.json` file:

    ```text
    {
      "name": "system.guest",
      "rules": [{
          "services": [
            "mountattach",
            "volume",
            "cloudbackup",
            "migrate"
          ],
          "apis": [
            "*"
          ]
        },
        {
          "services": [
            "identity"
          ],
          "apis": [
            "version"
          ]
        },
        {
          "services": [
            "cluster",
            "node"
          ],
          "apis": [
            "inspect*",
            "enumerate*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

2. Run the following `pxctl role update` command, specifying your `role.json` config:

    ```text
    pxctl role update --role-config role.json
    ```
