The `pxctl status` command provides an overview of your cluster, including:

- Cluster status
- Information on attached nodes
- Cluster summary
- Global storage capacity and usage
- Reported alerts

You can use the `pxctl status` command to view general information, check for alerts, and assist with cluster debugging.

The following example outputs the status of an operational cluster with 384 GB of total storage capacity:

Note the following about this example output:

* The `Node ID` field displays the identification string of the node on which you ran the `pxctl status` command. In this example, it's `abb4723e-efa3-432d-ad27-f929bc658862`. Beneath the `Node ID`, you can see local node and storage pool information.
* The `Local Storage Pool` field lists the number of storage pools on the node
* Pools are listed by their number, `0` in this example, and information is displayed in columns to the right. The capacity of the local storage pool is 128 GiB, and the amount of used storage space is 8.4 GiB.
* Under the `Cluster Summary` section, you can see information about the nodes in your cluster. This example cluster contains three nodes:
  * `abb4723e-efa3-432d-ad27-f929bc658862` (the local node)
  * `9ddf713b-0dbc-4e7b-bd6e-2ae648891072`
  * `0e466c6a-fef0-4752-b133-9bf257e9973a`
* The amount of storage space available on the `9ddf713b-0dbc-4e7b-bd6e-2ae648891072` node is 128 GiB, and the amount of used storage space is 8.4 GiB
* The amount of storage space  on the `0e466c6a-fef0-4752-b133-9bf257e9973a` node is 128 GiB, and the amount of used storage space is 8.4 GiB
* The total amount of storage space available across your cluster is 384 GiB, and the amount of used storage space is 25 GiB

The following example displays the status of a cluster that is in maintenance mode. Note that the status line has changed to `PX is in maintenance mode`.
