PX-Security is an important set of features of the Portworx platform that provide:

  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization, authentication, and ownership
  - Cluster-wide volume encryption
  - Namespace-granular or Storage-class BYOK volume encryption

This section describes the role-based access control (RBAC) model used by Portworx. For details on volume encryption, see [create encrypted PVCs](/operations/operate-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/create-encrypted-pvcs/).
