The {{< pxEnterprise >}} Operator takes a custom Kubernetes resource called `StorageCluster` as input. The `StorageCluster` is a representation of your Portworx cluster configuration. Once the `StorageCluster` object is created, the Operator will deploy a Portworx cluster corresponding to the specification in the `StorageCluster` object. The Operator will watch for changes on the `StorageCluster` and update your cluster according to the latest specifications.

For more information about the `StorageCluster` object and how the Operator manages changes, refer to the [StorageCluster](/reference/crd/storage-cluster) article.

## Grant the required cloud permissions

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:** If you're installing Portworx on OpenShift on-premises, you may skip this section and go straight to the [install](#install-portworx-using-the-openshift-console) section.
{{</info>}}

If you're installing Portworx on OpenShift on a cloud environment, Portworx requires different user and service permissions from OpenShift. Grant the appropriate permissions for your cloud environment.


### OpenShift on GCP

## Open ports for worker nodes

Ensure ports 17001-17020 on worker nodes are reachable from the control plane node and other worker nodes.

## Create a secret for Portworx Essentials

If you're running a **{{< pxEssentials >}}** cluster, then create the following secret with
your [Essential Entitlement ID](https://central.portworx.com/profile):

```text
kubectl -n kube-system create secret generic px-essential \
  --from-literal=px-essen-user-id=YOUR_ESSENTIAL_ENTITLEMENT_ID \
  --from-literal=px-osb-endpoint='https://pxessentials.portworx.com/osb/billing/v1/register'
```

## Install Portworx using the OpenShift console

To install Portworx with OpenShift, you will first generate `StorageCluster` spec that you will deploy in your cluster.

1. Generate the `StorageCluster` spec with the [Portworx spec generator tool](https://central.portworx.com).

2. Within the Portworx Operator page, select **Create Instance** to create a `StorageCluster` object.

3. The spec displayed here represents a very basic default spec. Copy the spec you created with the spec generator and paste it over the default spec in the YAML editor on the OpenShift Console. Select **Create** to deploy Portworx.

4. Verify that Portworx has deployed successfully by navigating to the **Storage Cluster** tab of the **Installed Operators** page. Once Portworx has fully deployed, the status will show as **Online**.

## Install Portworx using the command line

If you're not using the OpenShift console, you can create the StorageCluster object using the `oc` command:
