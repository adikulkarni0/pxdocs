Portworx logs management on Kubernetes using Elastic search, Kibana and Fluentd.

## Portworx logs on Kubernetes
Portworx runs as a DaemonSet on the Kubernetes cluster which ensures that it runs on each node as part of the Kubernetes cluster. To allow access to the logs of a failed node, pod or a container in kubernetes we would have to adopt a complete logging solution. The need to access or view logs of failed container workloads means that we would need to enable storage and the logs should have a separate lifecycle than that of the container that creates it.

Elastic Search, FluentD and Kibana allow us to setup a complete logging solution for accessing logs of the Portworx pods scheduled on the Kubernetes cluster.

Setup Elastic Search and Kibana on your Kubernetes cluster by following the steps mentioned in the document here
[Elastic Search and Kibana on Kubernetes](/operations/operate-kubernetes/application-install-with-kubernetes/elastic-search-and-kibana)

## Log Collection
Fluentd is a log collector which enables you to log everything in a unified manner. Fluentd uses JSON as the log collection format.

### Install fluentd on your Kubernetes cluster.
fluentd runs as a deamonset on the Kubernetes cluster thus allows it to collect logs from all the Portworx pods placed on each node.
If the need is to also enable the entire kubernetes cluster level logging, then please add `@include kubernetes.conf` and add a relevant `match` directive in the `ConfigMap`

Create a file named ```fluentd-spec.yaml``` and apply the configuration using `kubectl`:

```

This configuration would enable cluster level logging for the Portworx Pods.

A bit more about fluentd.

The three important directives to be used to allow fluentd to collect logs.
a) source
b) filter
c) match

a) A source directive in the config file allows fluentd to understand its input sources. a source directive includes a `type` parameter which defines the input source. In the above specification the input type is mentioned as `tail` which is similar to `tail -F` and it tails the logs from the `path` variable.

b) A filter directive in fluentd allows modification of event streams. It is typically used to enrich data or, to filter out events from the input source or, to mask data for privacy considerations.

c) A match directive is the output or the action to be taken based on the input. In the specification above there is a `match` directive specified which inserts data into the elastic search cluster in the logstash format.

fluentd would collect logs from the `path /var/log/containers` and push them to the Elasticsearch database.

### Screen grabs

Login to the kibana dashboard and navigate to the `Management` submenu item. This allows you to create an index pattern which stores the collected logs. In our case the logs are stored in indexes with the name `px-logs-` followed by the date. This is configurable and can be changed in the `match` directive for the variable `logstash_prefix`

![CreateKibanaIndexpatterns](/img/kibana-px-index-pattern.png)

Upon creation of the Index, the screen would show you all the fields which are part of the index. These fields can be used for searches and filtering while viewing the logs.

![FieldsoftheIndex](/img/px-logs-fields.png)

Navigate to the `Discover` menu item. You can select the index pattern which was created earlier. It would list the available colums on the left hand side menu. In our setup, the columns with the pod name, hostname, log and the time are selected, but any columns could be selected for viewing the logs. You could also save the searches and search/view logs based on time.
