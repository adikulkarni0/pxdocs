## Portworx Alerts

Portworx provides a way to monitor your cluster using alerts. It has a predefined set of alerts which are listed below. The alerts are broadly classified into the following types based on the Resource on which it is raised

1. Cluster
2. Nodes
3. Disks
4. Volumes
5. Pools

Each alert has a severity from one of the following levels:

1. INFO
2. WARNING
3. ALARM
